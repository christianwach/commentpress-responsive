Commentpress Responsive Theme
=============================

An alternative base theme for the *CommentPress Core* plugin that responds more elegantly to screen size and refines the *CommentPress* experience for desktop, tablet and mobile browsers alike.

This theme will be bundled with *CommentPress Core* at some stage and is now the recommended theme for *CommentPress Core* in any *WordPress* and *BuddyPress* scenario.

You can install *CommentPress Core* from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/commentpress-core/) or contribute to it via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IFBook/commentpress-core).
